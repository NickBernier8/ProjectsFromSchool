This program was created as part of my CS-210 Programming languages class
It is a simple clock that displays both military time and standard time.
The user is asked to set the time by giving an initial value for hours, minutes and seconds.
They can then add an hour, minute, or second, and the program updates the clock display.
I think I did an especially nice job with the display on this project. It updates in real time.
I could have improved this code by adding exception handling to the user inputs, the code is not object oriented.
I made this code readable by adding clear but concise comments that give a good overview of all code blocks.
