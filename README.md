The DriverPass project was an assignment for my CS-255 Systems Analysis and Design course.
We playing the role of an employee at a software development company who's clinet was the company DriverPass.
Driverpass was a company that was looking to create a mobile app and website for students to learn driving laws and schedule in person driving lessons.
Our job in the company was to create UML case diagrams, activity diagrams, sequence diagrams, and class diagrams for the DriverPass system.
In the end we created our diagrams for DriverPass and then created a presentation to present to the DriverPass company. 
I think that the thing I excelled at was breaking down the more technical aspects of Systems Design so that anybody could understand them, particularly in my presentation.
If I had to revise once thing that I did during this course it would be to update my UML Case daigram for driverpass.
When gathering the requirements for DriverPass I reread the DriverPass transcript several times and took notes to make sure than I knew exactly what the client was asking for. 
Then I tried my best to implement each requirement when designing the system. In the future I think that making case diagrams and class diagrams will be extremly important because they really helped me better understand how a system functions. They helped me visualize the different components of the system and helped me understand how they work together.
